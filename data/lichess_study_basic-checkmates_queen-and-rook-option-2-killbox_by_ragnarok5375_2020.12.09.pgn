{ The Kill Box Checkmate is a common strategy to slowly force a king to the end of the board by slowly pushing him with a queen and rook.

This is faster than the staircase method, and sometimes easier to pull off if there are more pieces on the board.

The formation can be repeated from as far away as necessary. }
