{ The easiest way to learn how to checkmate with a rook and king is the Box method. This can be used for a rook endgame as well.

The box method involves closing your opponent into a smaller and smaller imaginary box on the board. } { [%cal Gb5b8,Ga4b5,Gb5h5] }

{ Checkmating with a rook alone is not as easy as checkmating with a queen alone, but it employs the same Box methodology.

The best way is to slowly push your opponent back to the edge of the board again, but this time you’ll want to maintain opposition before pushing the opponent’s king.

Opposition involves both kings being 1 square apart, essentially staring at each other daring them to step forward, but they can’t! } { [%cal Gc4c5,Gc5h5] }
1. Rc6+ { The rook pushes the king back with check, and the white king controls the squares it can move forward. You will want to continue to achieve this formation until the king is on the edge of the board. } 1... Ke7 2. Ke5 { [%csl Ge6,Gd6,Gf6] } 2... Kd7 { When the king moves close to the rook, it must move to the other side of the king, as far away as possible.
If the defending king tries to get sneaky by going back and forth (this can sometimes trip up beginner players) then you’lll want to remember to skip a move where possible, as above.
Skipping a move, or marking time, is a chess term that is used when you want to force your opponent into a bad position (zugswang).
This will reduce the number of moves you need to achieve checkmate.
Since you can’t actually skip your turn, you can make a move on the board that seemingly wastes a move, but is really designed to put your opponent into a position they don’t want to be in and make a move they don’t want to make.
Continue forcing the king to the edge until checkmate is delivered. } { [%cal Gc6h6] } 3. Rh6 Ke7 { [%csl Gd6,Ge6,Gf6] } 4. Rh7+ Kf8 5. Ke6 { [%csl Gd7,Ge7,Gf7][%cal Gf8e8,Gh7h8] } 5... Kg8 { White must “mark time” again by moving to the other side while the black king runs to the very corner of the board.
Once on a8, it must move backwards to the only square, b8, where the rook finishes the game with the final horizontal check. } 6. Ra7 Kf8 { [%cal Gd7a7] } 7. Rb7 (7. Kf6 Ke8 8. Ke6 Kd8 9.

Be sure to remember that your rook won’t be able to protect itself as easily as a queen. Always make sure your rook is protected or has a nice amount of checking distance from the king. } *

{ Just like the 2 queen checkmate or the queen and rook, you want to alternate files, taking squares away.
With two rooks, you will need to “waste a move” or “mark time” as Yasser Serawan discusses in his endgame books.

Because the king can capture one of the rooks if unprotected, it’s important to remember this.

If you accidentally allow the king to capture 1 rook, you will need to give checkmate with a rook and king alone, covered below. }

1. Qb8# { A backrank checkmate occurs when the king is on the 1st or 8th row of a chess board and checkmate is delivered. It must be given by a rook or queen as they are the only pieces that attack horizontally.
This typical formation of 3 pawns is a common sight for either king. It is most common after castling because it provides safety. However, if you aren’t able to give your king an escape square, you can fall victim to backrank mates. } { [%csl Gd7,Ge7,Gf7] } (1. Rh4 Kf8 { [%csl Gg7] }) *

This checkmate involves a doublecheck, in which the king is attacked by two pieces. When this happens, the king must move. } *

The rook often removes an entire file from the king’s retreat. In this case, a simple check from anywhere will finish the king off. As long as the other squares are blocked off, the pawn’s check is more than enough.
A bishop, knight, or queen can deliver the mate as well in this type of situation. } *
