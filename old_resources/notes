universal chat log created when game is started with a new opponent
	messages sent during games have a game id value which allows us to find the p2p in game chat, keeping spectator chat separate

	draw 1
	win 2
	each consecutive game after a win increases your streak, and number of wins - 3 is what is added to the 2 for each win?
